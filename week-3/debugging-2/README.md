# Debugging assessment

In this folder is the code for a simple weather website. The main user flow is:

1. Search for a city
2. Get current temperature back
3. Get quirky message back depending on the temperature

You can see it in action here [https://debugging-weather-app.netlify.app](https://debugging-weather-app.netlify.app)

Your task is to fix this code so that it works as the working version above. There's a mix of syntax errors, runtime errors and logic errors that you need to address.

Good luck!
